##JPad##
JPad is a lightweight, classic-style Notepad replacement for Windows 11, built with .NET Core 8 and WinForms. It’s designed to be simple, fast, and private — with no telemetry, no ads, and no links to tracking services.

##Features##

- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Word wrap toggle
- Dark mode support
- Font selection and persistence
- Find / Replace with case sensitivity and escape sequence support (\t, \r\n, etc.)
- Print and page setup support
- Status bar with line/column tracking
- Settings saved locally in a JSON file
- No internet access required
- No telemetry, analytics, or background services


##Privacy First##
JPad does not:

- Send any data over the internet
- Include any third-party libraries or telemetry
- Track usage, behavior, or system information

All settings are stored locally in a plain-text .conf file next to the executable.
